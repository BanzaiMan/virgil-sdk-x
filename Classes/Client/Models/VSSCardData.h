/**
 * This class represents the cornerstone model of the Virgil infrastructure.
 *
 * Virgil Card is an object containing the public information about the user.
 * This information includes the user's identity, so that other users can find him/her.
 * Also it contains the public key object, so other users can encrypt data for this
 * particular user and also they can verify signatures composed by this user.
 *
 * For the most sensitive operations with Virgil Services, it is required that
 * users have the Virgil Cards authorized (or confirmed, that this particular user
 * posesses the information associated with the card).
 *
 * Virgil Card has two possible scopes:
 *
 * - Global (using Virgil Identity Service): in this case card's identity **MUST** have type kVSSIdentityTypeEmail.
 * Call to [VSSClient verifyEmailIdentityWithValue:extraFields:completionHandler:] initiates authorization process.
 * After that Virgil Identity Service sends a confirmation code to the email address which is set as a value of the card's identity.
 * User should get this code from the email and call [VSSClient confirmEmailIdentityWithActionId:code:tokenTtl:tokenCtl:completionHandler:]
 * with this code. After successful confirmation the validation token will be returned by the Serivce. This token then can be used with the SDK
 * for other operations.
 * - Private (using a third party service): in this case the card's identity may have any desired string as type. All responsibility of the card confirmation
 * is taken by the particular third party service (e.g. some developer's service).
 *
 * @see VSSIdentity
